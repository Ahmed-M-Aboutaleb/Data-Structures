# Data Structures

This repository contains implementations of various data structures in different programming languages. It is created by me a CS major student who is eager to learn and understand data structures.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide practical examples and implementations of common data structures. By studying and experimenting with these implementations, the student aims to gain a deeper understanding of how data structures work and how they can be used effectively in software development.

## Structure

The repository is organized into separate folders, each representing a different data structure. Within each folder, you will find the implementation files along with any necessary documentation or additional resources.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome. If you have any suggestions, improvements, or additional implementations of data structures, feel free to submit a pull request. Your contributions will help enhance the learning experience for others.
